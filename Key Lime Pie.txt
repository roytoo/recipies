Key Lime Pie

Make the crust first, then mix the filling.

INGREDIENTS

CRUST

Cinnamon (as much as you want)
Clove (as much as you want, buy remember it has a strong flavor)
1.5 cups graham cracker crumbs (~16 crackers)
1 Tbsp brown sugar
3 Tbsp butter

FILLING

6 large or extra large egg yolks
1 14 oz can sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup fresh key lime juice (approx. 12 key limes)


VARIANTS

DARK CHOCOLATE LAYER ON CRUST
I make a variant (usually for Christmas) the has a thin layer of dark (bitter!) chocolate melted on the crust before the filing is added.



DIRECTIONS

CRUST

Mix the ingredients and press them into a 9" Pie plate.  Bake in a preheated 350 °F oven for 10 - 12 minutes until lightly browned.  Place on a rack to cool.


FILLING

Use an electric mixer on LOW and best the egg yolks until they are thick and turn a light yellow, but don't over mix.  Turn the mixer off and add the sweetened condensed milk.  Mix briefly on LOW, scraping the bowl to mix in an the yolk.  Mix in half of the lime juice on LOW, scraping the bowl to ensure good mixing.

Once the first half is incorporated add the other half of the juice and mix briefly on LOW until blended (just a few seconds).

Pour the filling mixture into the pie shell and bake at 350 °F for 12 minutes to fully set the yolks and kill any salmonella in the eggs.


You can enjoy warm, but most people prefer to place in the fridge to chill for at least an hour.

ENJOY!
